# GenAI Risk Assessment Tool (v0.1)

This project is a Python-based learning tool designed to explore
Generative AI security risks using concepts from the OWASP GenAI Security Project.

## Purpose
- Practice Python fundamentals in a GenAI security context
- Understand how GenAI systems can fail or be misused
- Translate technical behavior into risk and governance thinking

## What This Project Does
- Stores GenAI risks using Python lists and dictionaries
- Simulates how risks are accessed and evaluated
- Connects coding errors to real-world GenAI risk concepts

## Status
This is an early learning version (v0.1) and will evolve as my
GenAI security and Python skills grow.
